题目：180 连续出现的数字

SELECT DISTINCT Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM (SELECT Num,
             CASE
                 WHEN @prev = Num
                     THEN @count := @count + 1
                 WHEN (@prev := Num) IS NOT NULL

                 END AS counts
      FROM `Logs`,
           (SELECT @prev := NULL, @count := NULL) AS init
     ) AS tmp
WHERE tmp.counts >= 3
